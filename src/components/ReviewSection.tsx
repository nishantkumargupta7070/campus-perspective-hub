    review: "**Describe:** I completed my diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Madhupur Polytechnic in 2023. The college has a decent infrastructure with well-equipped labs and workshops. **Evaluate:** The faculty is knowledgeable and supportive, especially in practical subjects. However, the library needs more updated books and resources. Placement support is good with regular company visits. **Suggest:** The college should focus on improving digital resources and adding more modern equipment to labs.",

    review: "**Describe:** I studied Electrical Engineering for three years here. The college has potential but needs significant improvements. **Evaluate:** While some faculty members are excellent, others lack the practical knowledge needed for industry preparation. The electrical lab equipment is outdated and needs upgrading. However, the student community is supportive and friendly. **Suggest:** Investment in modern lab equipment and regular faculty training programs would greatly improve the quality of education.",
